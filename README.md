I am a 22 year old student based in New York, NY. I am currently studying Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at Columbia University. I recently received my undergraduate diploma from New York University, where I majored in International Relations and double minored in Chinese and Data Science. I enjoy using statistical techniques and coding to learn more about the real world. 

My current favorite topic is machine learning, but I am interested in learning more data visualization techniques, SQL, and time series data analysis.

- I am currently learning: Machine learning with Python, spatial statistics with QGIS, R, and Python, and survey methodology
- Languages: R, Python, Java
- Movie: Before Sunrise
- TV Show: Fleabag
- Song: Southern Nights by Whitney
- Food: Anything to do with black truffles
